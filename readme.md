## Windfall Elimination Provision, USA Social Security

This is a tool to help retirees affected by the Social Security Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). WEP mostly affects public servants like teachers and firefighters, and can mean a reduction in SSA benefits of up to 50%. This tool will help affected workers better plan retirement and self-advocate with the Social Security administration.

## What is inside?
* [SSACalculator.org App](https://ssacalculator.org) for best user experience on tablets, ideally pursued with a case worker.
* Official Social Security earnings record PDF scraping using PDF.js (and XML format parsing)
* Typescript type checking to ensure matching types between replicated SSA algorithms and Gatsby/React.
* Tests to compare output of known [documented](http://thadk.net/anypiamac-docs/html/) [examples](http://thadk.net/anypiamac-docs/) to the Microsoft Windows-based Social Security Detailed Calculator.
